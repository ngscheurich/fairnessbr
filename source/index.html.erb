    <p class="lead">On July 23, 2014, the Baton Rouge Metro Council considered an item on its agenda called <a href="/fairness-ordinance.pdf" title="Baton Rouge Fairness Ordinance (PDF)">&ldquo;The Fairness Ordinance&rdquo;</a>.</p>
    <p class="lead">This ordinance would specifically enumerate protected classes&mdash;including those protected at the federal and state level&mdash;but, with one important distinction: it included definitions for <em>sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression</em>.</p>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>For nearly <em>four hours</em>, the Metro Council entertained public comment from people both for and against the ordinance.</p>
      <p>As I sat in the Council Chambers for the duration, listening to the passionate debate, it struck me how negative, vitriolic and plainly offensive some of the opposition comments were.</p>
      <p>I believe Baton Rouge is filled with reasonable people&mdash;many of whom are of devout faith&mdash;that would be as horrified as I was at the hatred that was on display.</p>
      <p>I knew that if I made it easy for my fellow citizens to read what was being said on their behalf by their religious leaders and breathren, they would be left as aghast as I had been.</p>
      <div class="action">
        <p>This is my attempt. <strong>Below you will find their <em>exact words</em></strong>&mdash;professionally transcribed from the <a href="http://batonrougela.swagit.com/play/07232014-770/#18">video available on the Metro Council website</a>.</p>
        <p>Please, <strong>share this with your friends and family</strong>. And, if you agree&mdash;if you want the discrimination to stop&mdash;please <a href="https://brgov.com/dept/council/">email your councilmember</a> and tell them to <strong>vote yes for fairness</strong>.</p>
