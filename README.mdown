# Fairness for Baton Rouge

This site is built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), a static site generator. The source is available in the `source/` directory. Middleman builds the site from the parsed ERb, CoffeeScript and SCSS into a `build/` folder. The production site on S3 mimics this folder.

To run locally:

    middleman server

To build:

    middleman build

To deploy to S3:

    middleman s3_sync
